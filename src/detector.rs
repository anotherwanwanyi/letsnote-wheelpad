        //    a single-pass branch that emits at most one tick per packet
        //    and silently loses angle on fast sweeps; we drain fully so
        //    that arbitrarily fast circles still scroll the proportional
        //    amount.
        //
        //    Sign convention preserved from Windows: positive accumulator
        //    overflow yields a tick value of -1. The user-visible
        //    `WheelReverse` flip is applied at the emit layer
        //    (uinput.rs), not here. A clockwise gesture (which integrates
        //    positive in screen-Y-down coords) therefore returns negative
        //    ticks; passing the value through to uinput unchanged scrolls
        //    the page DOWN, matching Windows.
        //
        //    Known quirk preserved as a comment for archaeology:
        //    FUN_140005bf0 line 120 contains a defensive clamp that snaps
        //    the accumulator to -π after the +2π correction rather than
        //    to 0. Our while-loop makes the clamp unreachable, but the
